# Project 2 - Samurai's Code - Castle Journal

## 100-famous-castles
In 2006, The Japanese Castle Association released a guide book including the Top 100 Japanese castles to visit. This book enables you to collect stamps from each castle adventure you embark on. However, the guide book is written entirely in Japanese. Our application, Castle Journal, is an English companion app for the guide book. You can Use Castle Journal to assist in adequately planning your trip, share your experiences, and update an online version of your stamp book with the stamps you've collected.
When visiting one of Japan's famous castles, you can apply a unique rubber stamp to your notebook. Use this application to prepare for a trip, read and write reviews, and learn fun facts on your journey to collect all 100 stamps.
